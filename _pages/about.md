👋 I am Yu Sun (孙瑜), a third-year Master student at Fudan University advised by Xipeng Qiu and Xuanjing Huang. I acquired
my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at Fudan University. Meanwhile, I'm currently a research intern at Shanghai AI
Lab.

fundamental language ability. Previously, I worked in the area of **Information Extraction**.
